		        <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">Khana Khazana was made out of a desire to bring the captivating and enrapturing effervescence of a classic India trattoria to the hub and bub that is Brisbane's, James Street. The food shall be focussed on perfecting simple, classic Italian dishes with a nod to the Indian climate and dining sphere, honouring fresh produce and seasonality. We will be working from the foundation up, creating our own pastas and breads, all in house. The wines work similarly; India in provenance or variety, they will serve to complement the dishes as they would in their traditional homes. Our staff are warm, gracious and cannot wait to welcome you into our home.</p>
